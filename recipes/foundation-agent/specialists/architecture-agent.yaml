    5. AUTOMATE for entropy reversal
    
    Match constraints to universal patterns:
    - Flow Dynamics, Fractal Scaling, Adaptive Feedback
    - Network Intelligence, Minimal Encoding, Layered Abstraction
    - Parallel Processing
    
    Core principle: As problem complexity increases, solution complexity must DECREASE.
