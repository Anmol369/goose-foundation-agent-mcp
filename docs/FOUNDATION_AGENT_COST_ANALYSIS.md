## Break-Even Analysis

### When does Foundation Agent pay for itself?

**Scenario:** Developer makes architectural decision

```
Foundation Agent cost: $0.50
Developer hourly rate: $75/hour
Break-even time: 0.4 minutes

If Foundation Agent saves >24 seconds of developer time, it's profitable.
```

**Reality check:** Foundation Agent typically saves 40 hours (rework prevention), not 24 seconds.

### Investment Perspective

```
Monthly cost (10 runs): $5.00
Annual cost (120 runs): $60.00
3-year cost (360 runs): $180.00

Prevented mistakes (avg 3 per year): 3 × $62,000 = $186,000
Net value over 3 years: $185,820
ROI: 103,233%
```

## Cost Justification Template

Use this template to justify Foundation Agent to your manager:

```
Subject: Foundation Agent ROI Analysis

Hi [Manager],

I'd like to use Foundation Agent for our [project name] architecture decisions.

Cost: $0.50 per architectural review
Expected usage: [X] times per quarter = $[X × 0.50]

Expected value:
- Prevent 1 architectural mistake: $50,000 (conservative)
- Save 40 hours of rework: $75/hour × 40 = $3,000
- Faster time-to-market: 2 months = $[revenue] opportunity

ROI: [value] / [cost] = [X]× return

Request approval for: [monthly/quarterly budget]

Data sources:
- Case study: E-commerce API (520,000× ROI)
- Industry avg: Architecture mistakes cost $50k-500k
- Foundation Agent benchmark: 92× faster than manual review

Let me know if you need additional justification.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## FAQ

**Q: Why does Foundation Agent cost $0.50 when ChatGPT costs $0.02?**

A: ChatGPT gives fast answers (50-70% accuracy). Foundation Agent validates reality across 4 phases with quality gates (>85% accuracy). You're paying for correctness, not speed.

**Q: Can I use a cheaper model (GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku)?**

A: Yes, but accuracy drops to ~60%. Foundation Agent's value comes from deep reasoning. Saving $0.40 to get wrong answers is a bad trade.

**Q: What if I run Foundation Agent and disagree with the output?**

A: Foundation Agent shows its reasoning (physics basis, confidence scores). If you have measurements proving it wrong, you can override. But data shows >85% accuracy.

**Q: Is there a free tier?**

A: Yes! 10 runs/month for open source projects. Students get 5 runs/month.

**Q: Can I self-host to avoid API costs?**

A: Yes, but you'll need to run Claude Sonnet 4 locally (expensive GPU) or use Anthropic's API anyway. Self-hosting typically costs more unless you're running >10,000 queries/month.

**Q: What happens if Foundation Agent fails?**

A: You get a full refund. If F-score < 0.6 (too uncertain), Foundation Agent refuses to charge you.
